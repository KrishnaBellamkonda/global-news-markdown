# global-news-markdown

### Description 
This is a self-updating news section that updates every hour.

### Set Up

* Make a New York Times account and get a Key for top stories section. Save the section as 
 ```
 KEY = (key obtained from a NYtimes API)
 ```

### Curious?
Come back in a few hours and seeif the news section has changed! (Is it too long?)

### Note
* If you are adding additional content to your readme (other than news section), then add it to the README_template.md file too. Do not remove the The W.H.O. urges wealthy countries to halt booster shots and send more doses to poorer nations.
