### Description 
This is a self-updating news section that updates every hour.

 ```
 KEY = (key obtained from a NYtimes API)
 ```

### Curious?

### Note
* If you are adding additional content to your readme (other than news section), then add it to the README_template.md file too. Do not remove the Demand for shots is increasing in less vaccinated states under siege from the Delta variant.
