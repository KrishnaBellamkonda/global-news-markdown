### Description 
This is a self-updating news section that updates every hour.

* Make a New York Times account and get a Key for top stories section. Save the section as 
 ```
 KEY = (key obtained from a NYtimes API)
 ```

### Curious?
Come back in a few hours and seeif the news section has changed! (Is it too long?)
