# global-news-markdown

### Description 
This is a self-updating news section that updates every hour.

### Set Up 
* Clone the repository
* Make a New York Times account and get a Key for top stories section. Save the section as 
 ```
 KEY = (key obtained from a NYtimes API)
 ```
*  Create a Personnal Access Token GitHub Token for allowing automatic commits and push of updated markdown. (Push and commit authorization is enough). Save this Token as 
```
TOKEN = (Personal Access Token)
```
* Done! You will have a self updating markdown in this respository!

### Curious?
Come back in a few hours and seeif the news section has changed! (Is it too long?)

### Note
* If you are adding additional content to your readme (other than news section), then add it to the README_template.md file too. Do not remove the Covid-19 Has Slammed Bangladeshâ€™s Hospitals. It Is Reopening Anyway.
